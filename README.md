# Kubernetes Portfolio – CKA-Oriented Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of *hands-on Kubernetes projects* designed to demonstrate real-world, production-ready Kubernetes skills.

The projects follow a progressive learning path, moving from core Kubernetes fundamentals to advanced concepts such as *security, autoscaling, ingress, and zero-trust networking*.

All projects are aligned with *CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)* objectives and reflect scenarios commonly found in enterprise environments.
